The Next Industry: The Era of Augmented Reality Glasses
The next great technological revolution will not only be on the screens we hold in our hands, but right before our eyes. Augmented reality glasses promise to become the next major global industry, transforming how we work, communicate, and interact with the physical world.

However, as with all emerging industries, the initial path is fragmented. The standard hardware that serves the industry is not always compatible between manufacturers. Each company develops its own components, sensors, systems, and interfaces, creating technological islands that hinder mass adoption and the sustainable evolution of the ecosystem.

The solution may emerge through the creation of an open hardware standard, adopted by most manufacturers. A set of common specifications that allows different devices, sensors, and systems to operate in harmony. As has happened in other areas of technology, one of the most promising answers will be open source or an open platform capable of establishing clear rules that manufacturers will want to include, until a global consensus is reached.

 This consensus could emerge from a free and independent organization, supported by various hardware and software manufacturers. By sponsoring the organization, these companies would help define the technical and philosophical foundations of the ecosystem, balancing innovation with compatibility. It would not be the dominance of a single brand, but rather a collective agreement on how technology should evolve.
Initially, the adoption of the rules will be pragmatic and accessible. The base hardware could include two displays, some essential positioning sensors, a 3D engine responsible for calculating the perspective of the virtual camera, and a video camera capable of capturing the surrounding environment. There will also be physical support for a mini-computer, the two displays, and a comfortable adjustment system for the user, ensuring ergonomics and prolonged use.

On the software side, simplicity will be key. You could start with a Linux operating system adapted to the hardware, or even a version of Windows tailored to initial needs. Over time, hardware and software will evolve together, incorporating more sensors, greater spatial precision, and more sophisticated abstraction layers.

 Natural evolution will lead to the use of virtual machines and cross-platform platforms, such as Mono, Java, or LLVM, allowing applications to be written once and run on multiple devices. Graphics APIs like OpenGL and DirectX will ensure performance and visual compatibility, regardless of the manufacturer.
The culmination of this evolution will be an ecosystem where software and hardware are truly compatible, interoperable, and future-proof. An environment where innovation is not hampered by incompatibilities, but accelerated by open standards, collaboration between companies, and a shared vision.
This is how the next industry will be born: not just augmented reality glasses, but a new digital layer over the real world—open, compatible, and built together.
